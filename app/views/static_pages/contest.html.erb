			<p> Nearly 1 in 3 children aged 2-19 in the United States is overweighed or obese. Unhealthy eating is the top contributor to childhood obesity. For young consumers to properly interpret nutrition labels and choose truly healthy food, they need in-depth knowledge in mathematics, including fractions, ratios, and proportional relationships.</p>
			<p>To promote nutritional awareness among children, Shooloo.org is hosting a healthy eating math story contest from May 2 to August 15, 2014. Students and teachers in grades 3-12 are invited to submit on Shooloo their own math <%= link_to "questions", posts_path %> regarding eating choices, conduct research, gather data, and devise solutions.</p> 
		</div> 
		<div id="awards">
			<h2>Awards</h2>
			<p> Participants have the potential to win awards in the following three categories:
				<ul>
					<li><p><strong>Educator Advocacy Award:</strong> Ten educators (i.e., teachers, administrators, technology coordinators, or curriculum coordinators affiliated with a school) may each win <strong>over $500</strong> worth of healthy snacks from our <a href="#sponsors">sponsors</a>. If you are an educator and an authorized Shooloo member, you may <%= link_to "log in", signin_path %> and <%= link_to "invite", new_invitemail_path %> your fellow educators to join Shooloo.</p><p>If an educator mentions your email address and invitation code during registration, both of you will earn 10 Advocacy points. When your referred educator imports his/her student roster into Shooloo, both of you will earn another 30 Advocacy points. If your cumulative Advocacy points rank among the top 10 highest, you will win an Educator Advocacy Award.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong> Teacher Expert Award:</strong> Ten teachers, one from each of the grades 3-12, may win <strong>over $500</strong> worth of healthy snacks from our sponsors. If you are a teacher, both you and your students may <%= link_to "submit", new_post_path %> healthy-eating-related math stories (i.e., word problems) on Shooloo to enter into the contest.</p> <p>Each time your students' entry is <a href="#qualification">qualified</a>, you will earn 10 Inspiration points. Each time your own entry is qualified, you will earn 20 Education points. If your cumulative Inspiration and Education Points combined rank the highest among all teacher participants within your grade, you will win a Teacher Expert Award.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Student Expert Award:</strong> Ten students, one student from each of the grades 3-12, may win <strong>over $200</strong> worth of healthy snacks from our sponsors. If you are a student, follow the guidelines in <a href="#win">How to Win</a> to enter the contest. Make sure that your submissions meet all the <a href="#qualification">qualification criteria</a>. If the number of your qualified entries ranks the highest among all student participants within your grade, you will win the Student Expert Award.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<div id="win">
			<h2>How to Win</h2>
			<p><strong>Winning the Teacher/Student Expert Award</strong> takes only a few simple steps as follows: 
				<ul>
					<li><p>If you are a Shooloo member, <%= link_to "log in", signin_path %>. If not, <%= link_to "sign up", signup_path %> -- it is free!</p></li>
					<li><p>On your <%= link_to "Alerts", my_alerts_path %> page or 
						<%= link_to "Home", root_path %> page, click on the blue button that says <%= link_to "Create A Math Word Problem Now!", root_path %></p></li>
					<li><p>When the post form opens up, click on the radio button beside “Yes! Enter my post into the healthy-eating math story contest.”</p></li>
					<li><p>Enter your question, answer, and other required fields.</p></li>
					<li><p>Click on the orange button that says “Save and Preview”.</p></li>
					<li><p>Review your entry and make sure that you have followed all of the qualification criteria.</p></li>
					<li><p>Click on the blue “Edit” button and make changes if necessary.</p></li>
					<li><p>Click on the blue “Publish” button if you are a teacher or the “Submit for Review” button if you are a student. That’s it!</p></li>
					<li><p>You may submit as many entries into the contest as you want as long as your publication credit remains above zero (see qualification criteria #3 below).</p></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><strong>Winning the Educator Advocacy Award</strong> is even simpler: 
				<ul>
					<li><p>If you are a Shooloo member, <%= link_to "log in", signin_path %>. If not, <%= link_to "sign up", signup_path %>. </p></li>
					<li><p>Once you become an authorized member, you will see an orange banner on the top of your home page. Clink on the <%= link_to "link", new_invitemail_path %> (i.e., any word in blue) and it will direct you to an invite message.</p></li>
					<li><p>Customize the message and send it to your fellow educators. That’s it!</p></li>
					<li><p>You will get an <%= link_to "alert", my_alerts_path %> in Shooloo whenever your fellow educators sign up and import their student rosters into Shooloo. If you don’t get such alerts in a few days, you may want to follow up with the people you’ve invited.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="qualification">
			<h2>Qualification Criteria</h2>
			<p>For an entry to qualify and earn you points towards winning an award, it must meet all of the following criteria. <a href="/attachments/contest_checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a> a one-page qualification check list to hand out to your students.  
				<ol>
					<li><p>It must be a math <strong>WORD problem</strong>, NOT a straightforward equation such as “x +3 = 5, what is x?”</p></li>
					<li><p>It must be a <strong>multistep</strong> problem whose solution requires 2 or more steps. Multistep means varied operations. If a problem repeats the same operation multiple times, it is counted as a one-step problem. For example, the following problem is counted as a 1-step problem because it simply repeats addition twice: “Sarah ate 500 calories for breakfast, 600 calories for lunch, and 700 calories for dinner, how many calories did she eat in all?”</p></li>
					<li><p>It must be <strong>at or above the author’s grade level</strong> based on the Common Core State standards. For example: if the author is an 8th-grade student but his/her question is at the 7th-grade level or lower, not only the question will be disqualified, but also the author will lose publication credits as a penalty. If his/her publication credit balance drops to zero, he/she can no longer submit any more question into the contest, nor can he/she publish any more posts on Shooloo.</p><p> For every grade his/her submission is below his/her grade level, he/she loses 10 points of publication credit. For example, if an 8th-grade student submits a 1st-grade question, he/she will lose 70 points of publication credit. Conversely, if his/her question is at or above his/her grade level, he/she will gain 20 points of publication credit as a bonus. </p></li>
					<li><p>Its answer must be <strong>mathematically correct</strong> and include a <strong>step-by-step explanation</strong> of its solution as shown in the <a href="#sample">sample problems</a>.</p></li>
					<li><p>Its question and answer must be <strong>grammatically correct with no spelling errors.</strong></p></li>
					<li><p>Its question must be <strong>clear, concise,</strong> and give enough information to arrive at an answer. </p></li>
					<li><p>It must be related to the topic of <strong>healthy-eating</strong>. For example, the following question is about eating but not healthy eating: “I ate 5 burgers every day in the past week. How many burgers did I eat in all?”</p><p> In contrast, the following question is about healthy-eating: “A burger has 900 calories, vs. a salad has 300 calories. How many fewer calories do I take in if I eat a salad instead of a burger?” </p></li>
					<li><p>Its content must be <strong>appropriate</strong>. It must NOT contain any of the following:
						<ul>
							<li><p>Watermarked images.</p></li>
							<li><p>Racial or cultural discrimination.</p></li>
							<li><p>Personal information, including any participants’ real names, school affiliation, phone numbers, or emails. </p></li>
							<li><p>Offensive or derogatory remarks. For example, it is not OK to say in a problem, “You are fat and should shed 50 pounds.” But it is OK to say, “I am overweighed and need to lose some weight.” The rule of the thumb is: if it is something that you don’t want anyone else to say about you, you shouldn’t say it about anyone else on Shooloo.</p></li>
							<li><p>Plagiarized content or content that infringes on the intellectual property of others. For example, a student shouldn’t copy the <a href="#sample">sample problems</a> verbatim without much change beyond the numbers or product names and submit them as his/her own entries.</p></li>
						</ul>
					</p></li>
					<li><p>Its content must be <strong>realistic</strong>. Students should conduct research on relevant data instead of plucking numbers out of thin air. For example: it is unrealistic to say, “I burnt 1,000,000,000,000 calories for every mile I walked”.</p></li>
					<li><p>It must reflect the author’s own <strong>research and original thinking</strong>. It should not be essentially the same problems as the ones already published on Shooloo. For example, the following two questions are essentially the same. “I ate 1/3 of an apple in the morning and ½ of the apple in the afternoon. What fraction of an apple did I eat in all?”  “I ate 1/3 of an orange in the morning and ¼ of an orange in the afternoon. What fraction of an orange did I eat in all?”</p></li>
