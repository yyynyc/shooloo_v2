			<p> Nearly 1 in 3 children aged 2-19 in the United States is overweighed or obese. Unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity are the top two contributors to childhood obesity. For young consumers to understand nutrition labels and make healthy eating decisions, they must utilize high-level mathematical skills, e.g., fractions, ratios, and proportional relationships.</p>
