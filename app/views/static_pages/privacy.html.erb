<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<h2>Effective date: March 1, 2013</h2>

<p>We at Shooloo Inc. ("Shooloo.org," "we," "us," "our”) know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. Remember that your use of Shooloo.org’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use here without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Please read on to learn more about how we collect and use your information; if you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy practices, please send us a detailed message to privacy@Shooloo.org.com, or write us at Shooloo Inc. c/o Alley NYC, 500 Fashion Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10018.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Shooloo.org collects and uses information from its Services users, including our treatment of personally identifiable information. <strong>This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that Shooloo.org does not own or control, or to individuals that Shooloo.org does not employ or manage.</strong></p>

<p><strong>HOW IS CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?</strong></p>

<p>If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s or guardian’s express consent. Review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and make sure you understand it, and do the same with the privacy policies of all websites you visit or mobile applications you use.</p>

<p>We only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in more detail in the Terms of Service) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@shooloo.org.</p>
 
<p>When we use the term "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information of individual, non-student registrants of the Services. References to "Children's Personal Information" only apply to personally identifiable information of users who have registered for the Services as minor students (i.e., students under the age of 18). General references to "information" apply to all users.</p>

<p>If you are a student registrant and your parent or guardian has signed up for the Services with an Access Code provided by your teacher, you understand that your parent or guardian can view all information within or associated with your Services account, including, without limitation, messages between you and your teacher and grades you received on assignments.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DOES SHOOLOO.ORG DISPLAY OR COLLECT?</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></P>
		<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way.

	</li> 
	<li>
		<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></P>
		<p>We receive and store certain types of usage information whenever you interact with the Services; this information is not Personal Information or Children's Personal Information. For example, Shooloo.org automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Shooloo.org cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Services, and the number and frequency of visitors to our site and its components.</P>
		<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or mobile device to enable our systems to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Shooloo.org cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children's Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children's Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your user name or email address is. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you may not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ most attractive features without cookies enabled.</P>

</ol>

<p><strong>What does Shooloo.org use my information for?</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Usage Information</strong></p>
		<p>Shooloo.org uses this type of aggregate data to enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Services, so that we can make the Services appealing and relevant to as many users as possible, and customize and improve those Services. As part of our use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners (in a non-personally-identifiable format) about how our users use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners' services and the Services to help provide you with an optimal online experience. We may link usage information to Personal Information and Children’s Personal Information that we collect through the Services, but we will only use this linked information internally (for example, to customize your experience), and will not disclose it in linked format to third parties. Additionally, certain usage-related information may be viewable in your user profile that may be displayed to other users, depending on your User Category; for example, a “badge” may displayed in your profile indicating that you have added content to your user “library,” or that you have logged into the Services more than a certain number of times.</p>
