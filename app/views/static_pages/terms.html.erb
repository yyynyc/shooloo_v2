<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>Effective date: March 1, 2013</h2>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT! If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many places, this is 18 years old), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these terms and agree to them for you, before you use Shooloo.org or provide any information to us. Please review this agreement with your parent or guardian so that you both understand how Shooloo.org works and what restrictions apply to your use of our websites and services. Remember: always get an adult’s permission before going online.</strong></p>

<P>Thank you for using Shooloo.org! Before you use our websites and services (“Services”), we need you to agree to some rules. When we use the word “Services,” we mean not only the Shooloo.org website, but also all the other websites, products, services and applications made available by Shooloo Inc. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us at support@Shooloo.org, or write us at Shooloo Inc. c/o Alley NYC, 500 Fashion Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10018, USA.</p>

<P>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Shooloo Inc. You must agree and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.</p>

<P>These Terms include the provisions in this document, and in the Shooloo.org Privacy Statement. Our Services are constantly changing to keep up with the dynamic needs of learners everywhere. Accordingly, these Terms might need to change, too. If they do change, we will do our best to tell you in advance by placing a notification on the Shooloo.org website, or we might send you an email. In certain situations (for example, where a change to the Terms is necessary to comply with legal requirements), we may not be able to give you advance notice. Changes to our Privacy Statement will be provided in advance.</p>

<P>If you don’t like the new Terms, you are free to reject them, which means that you won’t be able to use the Services anymore. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, then please remember that means you agree to all of the Terms.</p>

<P>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

<P>Shooloo.org takes the privacy of its users very seriously. We fully comply with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment.</p> 

<P>If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@shooloo.org.</p>

<P>If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our Privacy Statement. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them.</p> 

<P>If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.</p>

<p><strong>What are the basics of using Shooloo.org?</strong></p>

<p>First, you have to sign up for an account, and select a password and screen name (“Shooloo.org User ID”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You can’t select for your Shooloo.org User ID a name that you don’t have the rights to use or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. In certain situations, your Shooloo.org User ID may be selected for you by your school or district; the same rules apply to them when they select an Shooloo.org User ID for you. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf, as we described earlier). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity (for example, if you’re an administrator agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your district), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms.</p>

<p>You promise to only use the Services for your personal, internal, non-commercial, educational use, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for you using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>

<p><strong>What’s this intellectual property stuff I’ve been hearing about?</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong>The Content</strong></p>
		<p>The materials displayed or performed on the Services (including, but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (defined below), and so forth) (the “Content”) are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you publish or access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Shooloo’s) rights.</p>
		<p>You understand that Shooloo.org owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), creative derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>
		<p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>User Submissions</strong></p>
		<p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.” User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Statement to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Shooloo.org a license to translate, modify and reproduce such User Submission, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</p>
		<p>You also grant Shooloo.org the license to display, perform, and distribute your User Submission for the purpose of displaying that User Submission to all Shooloo.org users and providing you the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that User Submission in connection with Shooloo.org, provided that Shooloo.org will try to notify you if it uses your User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>
		<p>You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, irrevocable, and worldwide, for as long as your User Submissions are stored with us. When you delete your Shooloo.org account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Shooloo.org’s records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.</p>
		<p>Finally, you understand and agree that Shooloo.org, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media.</p>		
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>DMCA Takedown Policy</strong></p>
		<p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers like Shooloo.org removing material that they believe in good faith violates someone’s copyright. </p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</strong></p>

<p>Any information or content publicly posted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. The Services may contain, or direct you to websites containing, information you may find offensive or inappropriate; we can’t control that, but please let us know if it happens and we’ll try to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>We also can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services. But that doesn’t mean we don’t take security seriously; we require teachers, schools, and districts guard their Access Codes with the appropriate confidentiality, and we enable teachers with moderation tools for monitoring content published by their students.</p>

<p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>

<p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned, operated, or controlled by Shooloo Inc. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Shooloo Inc. is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>

<p>Shooloo Inc. has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Shooloo Inc. will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service (including without limitation the Publisher Software). By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.
</p>

<p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties (including without limitation Publishers). You agree that Shooloo.org shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>

<p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Shooloo Inc. is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Shooloo Inc., its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.</p>

<p><strong>Will Shooloo.org ever change the Services?</strong></p>

<p>Shooloo.org is a dynamic learning tool, so the Services will change over time. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), or without any reason, and without notice.</p>

<p><strong>Does Shooloo.org cost anything?</strong></p>

<p>The basic Shooloo.org Services are free and always will be – that is, we don’t charge for signing up for a basic, individual Shooloo.org account, or for a basic school or district subdomain. However, we may offer certain premium products and services for a fee. </p>

<p><strong>What if I want to stop using Shooloo.org?</strong></p>

<p>You’re free to do that at any time; please refer to our Privacy Statement as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.</p>

<p>Shooloo.org is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason, including your breach of these Terms. Shooloo.org has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>

<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important documents you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, or would not be in the interest of someone’s safety or security to do so.</p>

<p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@Shooloo.org.com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.</p>

<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>

		<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
		<p>You will be responsible for withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services.

You and Shooloo.org agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Shooloo.org, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein).
