Dear <%= @user.first_name %>(<%= @user.screen_name %>),

An alarm has been set off on your student <%= @author.first_name %> <%= @author.last_name %>'s comment id #<%= @alarmed_comment.id%>. 

Please access https://fun.shooloo.org/alarmed-posts and review the alarmed comment. If it is indeed inappropriate, please tell <%= @author.first_name %> to edit the comment. <%= @author.first_name %> can click on any word in the comment, and it will change into an editing mode. <%= @author.first_name %> should also review the video tutorial at https://fun.shooloo.org/videos/how-to-make-a-winning-comment-on-a-word-problem-about-minecraft and learn how to give constructive feedback.

After the comment is cleaned up, you can unalarm it, and it will become visible again to the public. 

If there is nothing wrong with the comment and the alarm was false, you don't need to take action. The teacher of the person who raised the alarm has been notified and he/she will take appropriate actions.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at https://fun.shooloo.org/contact
