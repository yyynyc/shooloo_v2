Dear <%= @user.first_name %>(<%= @user.screen_name %>),

An alarm has been set off on your student <%= @author.first_name %> <%= @author.last_name %>'s post id #<%= @alarmed_post.id%>. 

Please access https://fun.shooloo.org/alarmed-posts and review the alarmed comment. If it is indeed inappropriate, please tell <%= @author.first_name %> to edit the post. <%= @author.first_name %> can go to "Posts" in the top menu bar, then click on "My Hidden Posts". Underneath each post there is a green button with a pencil and the word "Post" on it. Click on that green button, and it will take you to the editting view of the post. 

After the post is cleaned up, you can unalarm it, and it will become visible again to the public.  <%= @author.first_name %> should also review the video tutorial at https://fun.shooloo.org/videos/how-to-create-an-enchanting-word-problem-aligned-with-the-common-core and the site rules at https://fun.shooloo.org/rules

If there is nothing wrong with the post and the alarm was false, you don't need to take action. The teacher of the person who raised the alarm has been notified and he/she will take appropriate actions.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at https://fun.shooloo.org/contact
