Dear <%= @user.first_name %>(<%= @user.screen_name %>),

Your student, <%= @alarmer.first_name %> <%= @alarmer.last_name %>, has set off an alarm on someone's comment/post. 

Please access https://fun.shooloo.org/alarmed-posts and review the alarmed post/comment. If it is indeed inappropriate, you don't need to take any action. The post/comment's author's teacher has been notified and he/she will take appropriate actions.

If there is nothing wrong with the comment and the alarm was false, please tell <%= @alarmer.first_name %> to refrain from raising false alarms. Otherwise he/she will be banned from the Shooloo web site. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at https://fun.shooloo.org/contact

Best regards,

Shooloo Team
