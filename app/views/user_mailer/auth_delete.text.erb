Dear <%= @user.first_name %>(<%= @user.screen_name %>),

Your math teacher has removed you off her roster on Shooloo. You will no longer be able to publish your own posts or comment on other people's posts.

Howevever, if you would like to keep your followers on Shooloo and continue to follow other users, rate their posts, or like their posts, you can request referrals from other Shooloo members you know at https://fun.shooloo.org/referrals/new

If you still want to publish your own posts, you can ask your current math teacher to join Shooloo and then give you authorization! https://fun.shooloo.org/signup

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact us at https://fun.shooloo.org/contact
