Dear Parent,

Your child -- <%= @user.first_name %> <%= @user.last_name %> -- has signed up to become a member of Shooloo.org.

Shooloo is a secure online learning platform where students can publish their own math word problems, get feedback from their peers and teachers, and continuously improve their math and language skills. 

Shooloo is developed based on educational researches that when students write their own word problems, their math test scores improve quickly. As you are aware, the newly implemented Common Core State Standard has placed a far stronger emphasis on word problems than ever before. Teachers are using Shooloo to help students prepare for the state exams. In addition, we believe that Shooloo can help students improve their communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.

In order for <%= @user.first_name %> to use Shooloo, he or she must have your permission. You must read and agree to the Shooloo Terms of Service (https://fun.shooloo.org/terms/), Privacy Statement (https://fun.shooloo.org/privacy/), and Rules of Conduct (https://fun.shooloo.org/rules/) on <%= @user.first_name %>â€™s behalf. Please review the aforementioned three documents with your child and note that these policies may change over time, so you should review them again when you or your child receives a notification that they have been updated.
